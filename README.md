# image-sorter
I have a LOT of photos and sometimes I just want to sit back and look at them. But when I do so, it takes me ages to find, what I'm looking for. Sooooo, new coding challenge!


How to use:
1)Open 'sort.py' a dialog will pop up.
2)Select your desired folder to sort in the dialog by clicking 'Browse' and click 'Sort'.
3)All the images in the folder(.jpg,.jpeg,.png) will get sorted(by date taken) into folders like: year->month->day->photo(ex.: 20->July->13->example.png).
4)That's it, you have got your images perfectly sorted.
